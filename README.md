# GermanStudyGuide

A study guide app for English speakers to learn German with a focus on vocabulary memorization.

User accounts and the save information for them are stored on a remote MySQL database. 

Vocabulary and other data from the remote database is stored on the local device using ROOM.

The vocabulary activities store the score and frequency of every word, which then determines what vocabulary will be reviewed during the activity. This results in a smart and efficient learning exercise.

This will not compile as a few files have been left out for security purposes.
